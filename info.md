Git is a tool which allows you to backtrack to prev changes u made in any of your file in a repo compared to the current position 
For instance , if u have deleted some of your files in your repo and also made some changes to existing files, but now u want to undo that, u can simply go back to any previous commit of yours and access the prev data
